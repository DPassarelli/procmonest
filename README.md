**A promise-based child process monitor to ensure reliable testing of local servers written in JS.**

This project adheres to the `standard` coding style (click below for more information):

## _Raison d'Ãªtre_

I wanted to create a set of reliable, end-to-end tests for a REST API that I was working on. In order to do this, I decided to write some code that would start up the server in an entirely separate process, and monitor its `stdout` to see when it was ready to accept requests. This worked out so well that I started replicating the code across projects, and, of course, that's when it should become an npm module.

## Getting started

Install via [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-packages-locally):

    npm install procmonrest --save-dev

Or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/usage#adding-a-dependency):

    yarn add procmonrest --dev

Then create a new instance of `Procmonrest` and wait for the `start()` method to resolve before running your tests. Afterwards, wait for the `stop()` method to resolve before continuing on to the next test suite, or the next step in your build process.

For example (using [mocha](https://mochajs.org)):

```js
import Procmonrest from 'procmonrest' // or const Procmonrest = require('procmonrest')

describe('an end-to-end test', function () {
  const serverProcess = new Procmonrest({
      command: 'node .',
      waitFor: /listening on port \d{4,5}/i
    })

  before(() => {
    return serverProcess.start()
  })

  after(() => {
    if (serverProcess.isRunning) {
      return serverProcess.stop()
    }
  })

  ...
})
```

## Be careful!

You can create as many separate instances of `Procmonrest` as you like; however, keep in mind that you will not be able to run multiple copies of the same child process if they are all competing for the same system resources. For example, you will not be able to run more than one HTTP server locally if they all attempt to listen on the same TCP port. 

Therefore, you should carefully plan where in the test suite you will call `start()` and `stop()` in order to avoid resource contention.

## Documentation

Instances of `Procmonrest` must be created using the `new` keyword. 

### Constructor options

| Key | Type | Value |
|-----|------|-------|
| `command` | {String?} | The command to run (typically, whatever is used to start the local server). Defaults to `npm start`. |
| `reference` | {String?} | If specified, then this value will be noted inside the log file. |
| `saveLogTo` | {String?} | If specified, then the `stdout` and `stderr` output of the child process will be saved to this location (instead of the default), which must be an absolute path spec including the file name. Use `null` or `false` to prevent the creation of a log file altogether. |
| `waitFor` | {RegExp} | A [regular expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) that each line of output from the child process will be tested against. As soon as a match is made, then the process will be considered "ready for testing". | 

### Properties

#### `isRunning` {Boolean}

Returns `true` when the child process has started and is ready to be tested.

### Methods

#### `start` returns {Promise}

This spawns the child process, and resolves once the specified pattern is matched in the child process's `stdout`. The promise will be rejected for any of the following reasons:

1. The process exits before the pattern is matched. If this is the case, then the returned `Error` object will have a property called `exitCode` that equals the exit code of the child process.
2. The log file cannot be written to.

#### `stop` returns {Promise}

This method calls [tree-kill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tree-kill) on the child process, and resolves once that is complete. The promise will be rejected if the child process is not running.

### Logging

Each instance of `Procmonrest` saves all `stdout` and `stderr` output from the child process to a log file, along with some information about the process itself. The location of the log file defaults to the same as the file containing the code that creates the instance of `Procmonrest`, and the name will be the same as that file, but with the `.js` extension changed to `.log`. For example, if the file containing the code `new Procmonrest()` is located at `test/logging.spec.js`, then the log file will be created at `test/logging.spec.log`.

Each run will create a new log file, and previous versions will be overwritten.

## Safety features

In an attempt to avoid any misuse (whether intentional or not), the current working directory for the child process will be the same as the parent.
