**A promise-based child process monitor to ensure reliable testing of local servers written in JS.**

This project adheres to the `standard` coding style (click below for more information):

## _Raison d'Ãªtre_

I wanted to create a set of reliable, end-to-end tests for a REST API that I was working on. In order to do this, I decided to write some code that would start up the server in an entirely separate process, and monitor its output to see when it was ready to accept requests. This worked out so well that I started replicating the code across projects, and, of course, that's when it should become an npm module.

## Getting started

Install via [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-packages-locally):

    npm install procmonrest --save-dev

Or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/usage#adding-a-dependency):

    yarn add procmonrest --dev

Then create a new instance of `Procmonrest` and wait for the `start()` method to resolve before running your tests. Afterwards, wait for the `stop()` method to resolve before continuing on to the next test suite, or the next step in your build process.

For example (using [mocha](https://mochajs.org)):

```js
import Procmonrest from 'procmonrest' // or const Procmonrest = require('procmonrest')

describe('an end-to-end test', function () {
  const serverProcess = new Procmonrest({
      command: 'node .',
      waitFor: /listening on port \d{4}/i
    })

  before(() => {
    return serverProcess.start()
  })

  after(() => {
    return serverProcess.stop()
  })

  ...
})
```

## Be careful!

You can create as many separate instances of `Procmonrest` as you like; however, keep in mind that you will not be able to run multiple copies of the same child process if they are all competing for the same system resources. For example, you will not be able to run more than one HTTP server locally if they all attempt to listen on the same TCP port. 

Therefore, you should carefully plan where in the test suite you will call `start()` and `stop()` in order to avoid resource contention.

## Documentation

Instances of `Procmonrest` must be created using the `new` keyword. 

### Constructor options

| Key | Type | Value |
|-----|------|-------|
| `command` | {String} | The command to run as a separate process (typically whatever is used to start the local server). |
| `waitFor` | {RegExp} | A [regular expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) that each line of output from the child process will be tested against. As soon as a match is made, then the process will be considered "ready for testing". | 
| `signal` | {String?} | A string indicating which signal will be sent to the child process in order to terminate it. Defaults to `SIGINT`, which is supported [cross-platform](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_signal_events). |

### `start()` returns {Promise}

This starts the child process and resolves once the specified output is matched. The promise will be rejected if an error is emitted in the meantime.

### `stop()` returns {Promise}

This sends the signal specified in the constructor options to the child process in order to terminate it. The promise will resolve once the process has exited, and the resolved value will be the corresponding exit code as a {Number}.
